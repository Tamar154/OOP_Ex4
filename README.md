# OOP_Ex4

In this assignment we will work once again on directed weighted graphs.

This time we use our classes form last assignment that include building the graphs and algorithms that we can use to find details about them.

The assignment will be to build a "Pokémon game". 

Were given a directed weighted graph,  a set of agents that will be located on it so they could catch as many Pokémon's as possible. The Pokémon's are located on the graph’s edges.

the agent needs to be on the edge to grab the Pokémon.

On the wiki link below, you will find all the information you need about the functions we used to build the game and our thoughts behind the design and the use of the algorithm.
